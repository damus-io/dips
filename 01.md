Image Metadata
--------------

`draft` `optional` `author:jb55`

Image metadata is additional information associated with urls in notes that
clients can use to provide a better experience when loading images.

Image metadata is an `imeta` tag that looks like this:

```json
{
  "content": "More image metadata tests donâ€™t mind me https://nostr.build/i/863321bb1ae68830ebcf9a343ca0a5e0ce2323d0a55b7fbe86f7a886cf61db8d.jpg ",
  "kind": 1,
  "tags": [
    [
      "imeta",
      "url https://nostr.build/i/863321bb1ae68830ebcf9a343ca0a5e0ce2323d0a55b7fbe86f7a886cf61db8d.jpg",
      "blurhash eVF$^OI:${M{o#*0-nNFxakD-?xVM}WEWB%iNKxvR-oetmo#R-aen$",
      "dim 3024x4032"
      "alt A scenic photo overlooking the coast of Costa Rica"
    ]
  ]
}
```

There can be multiple imeta tags for each image url in the content.

The `imeta` tag MUST have a `url`, and MUST have at least one piece of
metadata (`blurhash`, `dim`, etc). Otherwise it is invalid.

## Fields

`imeta` can have the following metadata fields:

- `blurhash`: A small hash representing a blurred version of the photo.
  This can be used to create blurry previews before the image is
  displayed.

- `dim`: The dimensions of the image. You can use the aspect ratio of
  the dimensions to properly size the blurhash

- `sha256`: The sha256 hash of the image. This can be used to detect if
  the content changes.

- `alt`: Accessible text label for the vision-impaired or text clients.

## Recommended client behavior

When uploading images during a new post, clients can include this metadata
after the image is uploaded and included in the post.

When pasting urls during post composition, the client could download the image
and add this metadata before the post is sent.
