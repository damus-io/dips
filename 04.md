# Quote Highlights

A `comment` tag may be added to create a quote highlight. This SHOULD be rendered like a quote repost with the highlight as the quoted note.

This is to prevent the creation and multiple notes (highlight + kind 1) for a single highlight action, which looks bad in micro-blogging clients where these notes may appear in succession.

p-tag mentions MUST have a `mention` attribute to distinguish it from authors and editors.

r-tag urls MUST have a `mention` attribute to distinguish from the highlighted source url. The source url MUST have the `source` attribute.
