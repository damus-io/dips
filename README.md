Damus Implementation Possibilities
==================================

The purpose of this repo is to document nostr specifications that damus
implements that didn't quite reach agreement amoung other nostr client devs.
These will always be backwards compatible changes that can be safely ignored by
other clients (optimizations, etc)

**DO NOT IMPLEMENT THESE**! They are non-agreed upon implementations that are
still in the process of being ratified as a NIP. They are simply here as
documentation and will be removed once a NIP is decided upon.
