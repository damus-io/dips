# Private Zaps

Private lightning zaps are a way to send a zap while not revealing the zap author. Only the receiver of the zap can see who sent the zap, and may include an optional private message.

## Private Zap Request Event

A `private zap request` is used to send a zap to a user but only revealing the sender's identity to the receiver.
An `anon` tag is added to the `zap request` event with the encrypted `private zap request` event.

The `private zap event` is encrypted using [NIP-04](04.md) between the `zap request` key and the recipient's pubkey. The `zap request` key is the ephemeral key used to sign the `zap request` event.
The encrypted `private zap request` event is then added to the `zap request` event as the `anon` tag bech32 encoded with the `hrp` of `pzap1` and the `iv` values of the encryption are added with an underscore followed by the iv being bech32 encoded wit the `hrp` of `iv`.

## Deterministic Ephemeral Keys

Ephemeral keys can be generated deterministically by generating a private key like so:

```swift
func generate_private_keypair(our_privkey: Privkey, id: NoteId, created_at: UInt32) -> FullKeypair? {
    let to_hash = our_privkey.hex() + id.hex() + String(created_at)
    guard let dat = to_hash.data(using: .utf8) else {
        return nil
    }
    let privkey_bytes = sha256(dat)
    let privkey = Privkey(privkey_bytes)
    guard let pubkey = privkey_to_pubkey(privkey: privkey) else { return nil }

    return FullKeypair(pubkey: pubkey, privkey: privkey)
}
```

The private key is generated using the sha256 of the following data concatenated together:

- our_privkey: is the user sending the notes private key
- id: the target note that you are zapping's note id
- created_at: the target note's created_at as a string

This allows you to decode private zaps that you have sent yourself by attempting to generate a matching pubkey from public data on the target note

Note that this will not work on the web, since NIP-07 does not support hashing the private key into other data.
